# SMSP

Student Management System Project.

A C++ console-based project for managing student records using file handling — add, view, search, update, and delete student data efficiently.

#### OVERVIEW:

The Student Management System is a menu-driven C++ project demonstrating the use of classes, objects, and file handling for persistent data storage. 
It’s designed to simulate how basic database operations (CRUD) work internally in C++.

##### FEATURES:

- ➕ Add new student records  
- 📋 Display all student data  
- 🔍 Search for a student by roll number  
- 🗑️ Delete a specific student record  
- ✏️ Update existing student information  
- 💾 Persistent storage using file handling (`data.txt`)

###### TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Language: C++

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Version Control: Git & GitHub

File Handling: fstream library
